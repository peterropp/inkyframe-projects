For my first project, "Inky_frame_dakboard_display", the goal is to take a custom Dakboard screen displaying calendar/weather/etc. and display it on the Inky Frame,with a 12 hour deep sleep between refreshes. 
This gives a twice-daily update to the calendar/weather to give an idea of the current day's conditions and schedule as well as the next day.
